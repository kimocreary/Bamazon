# Bamazon

* In this activity, I created an Amazon-like storefront called Bamazon with MySQL. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

* The customer will use the command line to enter node bamazonCustomer.js and will get back a list of products available.



* The user will then enter the product ID of the product they would like.



* The user will then enter the quantity of the product they want.



* The quantity will be updated in the inventory.
